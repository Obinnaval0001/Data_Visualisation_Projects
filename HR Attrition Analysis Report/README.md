## 5. Summary

The HR Attrition Dashboard highlights that employee turnover is primarily driven by factors related to job satisfaction, lack of career advancement, and poor work-life balance. By proactively addressing these areas—particularly for younger, junior-level employees in demanding roles—the organization can significantly reduce attrition rates and build a more stable, engaged workforce.
